Task: Website re-design for Maxx Content

This proved to be an interesting project. Upon joining the MaxxContent team I was immediately tasked with redesiging the website. The existing (dynamic) site was created with PHP. At the time I was only experienced with Javascript. So, in addition to creating my first official website, post coding bootcamp, I also needed to learn PHP.  

Admittedly somewhat naive and still new to the world of web development, I decided to create a static site (wireframe) using only HTML and CSS. My reasoning was simply to create the basic framework and "hopefully" the dev team in India could make sense of my static site and add the necessary code to make it a dynamic site. Somewhat of a pefectionist, this took me longer than it probably should have: floats really can be a pain!

Although in the end my initial idea of creating a static site did not pan out, I am proud of the framework I created. 

Key features of initial static site:
-Hero image background slideshow with a text overlay
-Single page navigation
-Incorporated floats and grids in layout
-Intentional use of black & white asthetic with selective use of brand color throughout (my attempt at being UI in my design)

Upon sharing my repo with the India dev team I was immediately met with a host of questions (understandably in retrospect). Apparently converting a static site to something dynamic requires more than I realized, not impossible just complicated.  I now have deeper appreciation for thinking like a programmer or better yet the Agile process.
