Task: Website re-design for Maxx Content

This proved to be an interesting project. Upon joining the MaxxContent team I was immediately tasked with redesiging the website. The existing (dynamic) site was created with PHP. At the time I was only experienced with Javascript. So, in addition to creating my first official website, post coding bootcamp, I also needed to learn PHP.  

Admittedly somewhat naive and still new to the world of web development, I decided to create this static site (wireframe) using only HTML and CSS. My reasoning was simply to create the basic framework and "hopefully" the dev team in India could make sense of my static site and add the necessary code to make it dynamic. Somewhat of a pefectionist, this took me longer than it probably should have: floats really can be a pain!

Although in the end my initial idea of creating a static site did not pan out, I am proud of the framework I created. 

Key features of initial the static site:

    1. Hero image background slideshow with a text overlay

    2. Single page navigation

    3. Incorporated floats and grids in layout

    4. Intentional use of black & white asthetic with selective use of brand color throughout (my attempt at UI in my design)

Upon sharing my repo with the India dev team I was immediately met with a host of questions (understandably in retrospect). Apparently converting a static site to something dynamic requires more than I realized, not impossible just complicated.  I now have a deeper appreciation for thinking like a programmer and the importance of adhering to the Agile/Sprint process.  

After considering the complexity of addressing their concerns (and now pressed for time with a swiftly approaching deadline) I quickly decided to abandon my static site and create a dynamic site with Wix. I would like to say that this was the panacea I was looking for, however, this also offered its own set of challenges: 
    1. How do you redirect a domain name? 
    
    2. What are A-records, CNames, and MX-records?
    
    3. Why doesn't our company email work anymore?
    
 Needless to say this has been a real learning experience. The beginning of countless more to come.
